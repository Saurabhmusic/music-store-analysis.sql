#  Digital Music Store Data Analysis (SQL)

##  Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a digital music store database (Chinook) to examine business performance. The goal was to identify the best-selling artists, top-performing countries, and customer spending behavior using SQL.

##  Tech Stack
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Tool:** MySQL Workbench
* **Concepts Used:** Joins (Inner, Left, Self), Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions.

##  Key Insights & Questions Solved
I wrote optimized SQL queries to answer the following business questions:

1.  **Customer Behavior:** Identified the best customers and their spending habits.
2.  **Market Analysis:** Found that **USA** is the biggest market for the music store.
3.  **Product Strategy:** Discovered that **Rock Music** is the highest-selling genre.
4.  **Sales Performance:** Identified **Iron Maiden** as the top-grossing artist.
5.  **Employee Analysis:** Analyzed organizational hierarchy using Self Joins.

##  Project Structure
* `music_store_analysis.sql`: Contains all 12 SQL queries (Basic to Advanced).
* `Chinook_Schema`: The database schema used for this analysis.

##  How to Run
1.  Download the `music_store_analysis.sql` file.
2.  Open it in **MySQL Workbench**.
3.  Execute the queries to see the insights.
